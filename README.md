# Sp√§tsche Bahn
An app to count how late the Deutsche Bahn got you in total.

## What this app should feature in the future:
*This may depend on the feasibility that has no been check yet*
- Upload your DB train ticket QR code and let the app do the rest.
- Contemplate how much time you lost due to delays.
- Collect excuses ! A tree fell on your line ? how unlikely, but when you think about it, if it wasn't a tree, it would have been something else. So why not collect all the excuses and display them in a funny way.
- Display statistics about your travels, e.g. how many times you were late, how many times you were on time (lol), how many times you were early (miracles CAN happen), what was your longest delay, what was your shortest delay, etc.
- See a total for all users, how much time was lost due to delays.
- Time is money ! Money in this app is represented by time lost due to delays. If you take DB trains, you'll be rich in no time!
- Other ideas ? Please open an issue or a PR.
